A wintry sky and the
broken streetlight cold wind.
Unknown  shadow the footpoint of
desertion.Freedom was taken.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
If it wakes up a gloomy ceiling.
A loughing
voice sinks in the eardrum
it is soiled.And violence
rapes me rapes me rapes me
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
Why was I chosen?
Someone should answer...
どうか酷い
夢だと答えて欲しい
どれだけ叫び
悶え 苦しめばいい
どうか酷い
夢だと教えて欲しい
千切れそうな
声で何度も叫んだ
〜♪〜
There is no hand of preparing of
disordred hair.
A laughing  voice sinks in the
eardrum
a faint temperature is
mixed in the midwinter.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
An understanding is impossible.
声を殺して
枯れそうな自分に
言い聞かせていた
生きる事を
見失わぬよう
声を殺して
震えた夜は
痛みに溺れていく
途切れそうな
息を許して…
どうか酷い夢だと
答えて欲しい
どれだけ叫び
悶え 苦しめばいい
どうか酷い夢だと
教えて欲しい
最後にもう
一度だけ笑ってみたい
